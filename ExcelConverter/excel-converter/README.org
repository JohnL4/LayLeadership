* Convert AccessACS Excel Output To A More-Usable Format

  The problem is that AccessACS (our church info system) spits out reports in Excel format that are
  (sort of) readable by humans, but not very useful for computers.  For example, we get a church
  member's name in one row, then a bunch of prior activities in the following rows.  Ideally, we'd
  get all that in one monster row or even separate linked tables.

  This utility will handle the conversion from AccessACS's output to a more useful form for us.

* Build, Run

  Test:

  : mvn test

  Build (also runs unit tests):

  : mvn package

  Copy Dependencies (really, only needs to be done the first time or when you change dependencies)

  : mvn dependency:copy-dependencies

  After this is done, you can zip up the generated jar file plus the dependencies and you /should/ have a complete,
  executable package.
