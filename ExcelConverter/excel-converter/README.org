* Convert AccessACS Excel Output To A More-Usable Format

  The problem is that AccessACS (our church info system) spits out reports in Excel format that are
  (sort of) readable by humans, but not very useful for computers.  For example, we get a church
  member's name in one row, then a bunch of prior activities in the following rows.  Ideally, we'd
  get all that in one monster row or even separate linked tables.

  This utility will handle the conversion from AccessACS's output to a more useful form for us.
