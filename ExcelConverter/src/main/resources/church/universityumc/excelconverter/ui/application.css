/* JavaFX CSS - Leave this comment until you have at least create one rule which uses -fx-Property */

/*
 * Note on -fx-base: This is a looked-up color 
 * (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/javafx/scene/doc-files/cssref.html#typecolor))
 * defined in the default stylesheet for JavaFX ("Modena", available at or near 
 * http://hg.openjdk.java.net/openjfx/9/rt/file/c734b008e3e8/modules/javafx.controls/src/main/resources/com/sun/javafx/scene/control/skin/modena/modena.css)).
 * You won't find it documented in the CSS Reference because it's not an official CSS property.  If you use
 * a different theme besides Modena (which is the default, as of Java 9, so you might not know you're using it)
 * that does not make definitions based on "-fx-base", then it will probably have no effect.
