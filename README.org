* Overview

  This repository is intended to capture my notes and various bits of software I write to help my Methodist church's Lay
  Leadership committee.

  In a Methodist church, the Lay Leadership committee is a committee comprised of lay members and led by one of the
  clergy (head pastor?) whose job is to recruit other lay members to server on all church committees.  It's kind of a
  recruiting/HR/sales activity.

  (A quick note on the license: I understand that, without a license, software really can't be used at all, from a legal
  perspective, without fear of being sued.  Probably not a giant concern for charitable organizations such as churches,
  but, just to be safe, I've picked the most permissive license I see.  Enjoy; just give me credit. :) )

* Design/implementation process

  Just a quick note to say this should be an iterative process, with lots of changes (big and little) along the way, as
  opposed to a bunch of up-front cogitation and programming followed by delivery of a final product that never changes.

  People who are change-averse will probably not be comfortable, but the end result should (eventually) be better than
  what would be delivered by a "waterfall" process.

* Tables

** Member

   Church member.

   - First Name :: 
   - Last Name ::
   - Phone Number ::
   - Email Address ::
   - Comments :: I guess this should be confidential, if we want to commit this to the cloud.  I think we can trust it,
                 for the most part, but maybe we shouldn't put anything TOO embarrassing in here.

** MemberInterest

   n-to-n link of Members and Interests.

   *NOTE:* AirTable can apparently handle n-to-n relations behind the scenes, so we don't need these explicit relation
   tables.

   - Notes :: Further notes on the particular member's interest, if any.

** MemberContactHistory

   Contact history. n-to-n.

   - Member ::
   - ContactTask ::
   - Date :: 
   - Notes ::
   - Result :: Explicit focus on results. :)
   - NextTask :: Don't know if we can automatically create records or not. Use Zapier?

** MemberCommitteeHistory

   n-to-n.  Maybe, for the purposes of AirTable, we want the member-history tables combined, so they can be presented in
   one stream.  Bad d/b design, but oh well.

   - Member ::
   - Committee ::
   - StartDate ::
   - EndDate ::
   - Notes :: Any (confidential) notes on that member's tenure on that committee.

** Committee

   Church committee.

   - Name ::
   - Blurb :: description of committee, for use in recruiting.  Really, the type of standard things we'd like to put in
              blurbs should be separate fields, so we can make sure to get them covered for all committees.
   - MeetingsPerYear :: assumption: 1-2-hour meetings
   - ExtraHoursPerMonth :: time required outside of meetings

** CommitteeMember?

   Not sure we need this, but it would be n-to-n.

** ContactTask

   A thing a lay leadership member is tasked with (mostly contacting church members to recruit them).  I assume the
   tasks LL is concerned with are contacts with church members.  Maybe contacts with clergy/committee chairs to get
   questions answered? Do we want to document that? Maybe, so we can get results captured?

   Note: In any system, "Task" turns out to be a hairy, nebulous concept, so we'll need to apply a little discipline
   here when deciding what this system will do.  (In fact, I just renamed this thing from "Task" to "ContactTask", to be
   more clear.)

   - Member :: Church member to contact
   - Assignee :: LayLeadershipCommitteeMember this task is assigned to.
   - Summary :: Short display text.
   - Description :: Notes pertaining to the task as a whole, not its history.  In case a task requires multiple contacts
                    (or steps of some sort? What would those be?), the results of each step would go in the
                    MemberContactHistory notes/result.

** LayLeadershipCommitteeMember

   Church members who are on the Lay Leadership committee.

   - Member :: Link back to church member, where the contact info will be stored

** Interest

   The type of thing a church member might be interested in doing.  Free-form-ish in that we shouldn't be afraid to
   create new ones of these things.

   - Name ::
   - Description :: Do we need this?  In case just the name isn't enough to describe it?  Or should the name really be
                    descriptive enough?

** Tag?

   Just seems like a good idea, rather than "category" (since a thing can really one ever be in one category).
   
   - Name ::
